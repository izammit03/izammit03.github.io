I am a 2nd year student at MCAST reading for a BEng (Hons) degree in Mechanical Engineering, and a part-time machinist at Kamoy Engineering. I am always open to learn something new wherever I go and with whoever I meet, which has opened the door for many opportunities during the past years.

My part-time work at Kamoy Engineering is centred around the role of a machinist, but frequently broadens with jobs requiring reconditioning, fabrication, and mechanical assembly/disassembly. I get to work on jobs coming from all industries present nationwide, primarily Maritime, Construction and Manufacturing. Some points on the activities that I engage with at Kamoy Engineering:
* Manual machining (turning, milling, slotting, surface grinding).
* Replication of damaged parts.
* Repairs involving machining & welding.
* Gear, spline & screw/thread cutting.
* Assembly & disassembly of various equipment for repair work.
* Machine tool repair & reconditioning.
* Water leak & pressure testing.
* Shaft straightening.

For 2 years I was a member of the University of Malta Racing team during the development of the EV24, the first all-electric race car to be fully designed & built in Malta, and later on compete in Formula Student 2024 at Silverstone. Was entrusted with developing the vehicle's steering system, along with an accumulator hand cart. Endless hours were spent in the team's garage, taking care of machining tasks in-house and any other problems that could be solved through my expertise. Some points on the experience I had with UM Racing:
* Got to be part of a wonderful team of down-to-earth aspiring engineers.
* Saw the development of an electric race car from start to finish.
* Designed & manufactured from the ground up, the vehicle's steering system & a hand cart for accumulator.
* Machined critical parts through Kamoy Engineering (drivehsafts, spline hubs, sprocket carrier, anti roll bar).
* Learned basic TIG welding, electronics, various concepts in motorsport engineering.
* Improved upon my CAD design & machining skills.
* Travelled to Silverstone for FS 2024, helping the team in every way possible.

Some points about where I originally began:
* Was exposed to engineering very early on due to my father's occupation as a mechanic.
* Developed great interest towards making things during secondary school, including electronics (i.e. arduino).
* Took part in various projects in secondary school, such as building a soap box go-kart from the ground up.
* Developed great interest towards mechanical design, and began practicing both machining & CAD design around this time.
* Pursued the MCAST Advanced Diploma in Manufacturing (MQF/EQF Lvl 4).
* Joined the workforce at a young age through an apprenticeship programme, working as a toolmaker for Trelleborg Sealing Solutions.
* Was entrusted with hands-on work on the company's compression moulding tooling from day one, taking every opportuniy possible to learn, with tasks ranging from basic mould assembly & maintenance, to more tedious & demanding machining of components, often times with tolerances down to 5Âµm.
